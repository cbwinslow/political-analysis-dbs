## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please open a private security advisory or email the maintainer (see repository profile). Do not open a public issue containing exploit details.

## Hardening Recommendations
- Use read-only database role for API runtime.
- Rotate API keys (govinfo, OpenStates, ProPublica, Cloudflare) regularly.
- Enforce HTTPS at edge (Cloudflare proxy).
- Restrict inbound ports to necessary services (80/443/8100, 5432 internal).
- Consider adding rate limiting / auth for write endpoints if exposed publicly.

## Data Sensitivity
Legislative texts are public domain (generally), but aggregated or enriched data might carry analytic valueâ€”avoid unintentional exposure of internal notes or pipeline logs.
